# BIEN3-and-Mapping-Tutorials

This repository contains useful (hopefully) handouts and sample scripts to help with geo-spacial visualization of the BIEN3 data. There are also examples of how to request the data from their database and a few functions to make this whole process easier. The code is written in R and uses SQL to talk with the BIEN3 database. This repository is intended to be a resourse for Dr. Andrew Kerkhoff's lab group at Kenyon College.

For extra help on GitHub, https://guides.github.com/ and http://stackoverflow.com/ are great places to start.
